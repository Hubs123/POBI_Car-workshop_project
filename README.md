This project is a C++ application designed for a car workshop management system. It enabled me to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The application efficiently organizes and manages clients, services, and repairs, demonstrating practical implementation of OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
This project showcases OOP's practical applications by modeling real-world relationships in a workshop environment. It emphasizes reusable, maintainable code through abstract classes, while inheritance and polymorphism allow flexibility in extending system functionalities.

Additionally, this application was a valuable exercise in translating a conceptual UML diagram into functional C++ code, bridging design and implementation.
